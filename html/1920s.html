                        The 1920s was a time of significant <b>cultural change</b>, particularly for women. The <b>suffrage movement</b> achieved major milestones, granting women greater political rights in many countries, including the crucial right to vote. This newfound independence was vividly expressed through the bold and carefree fashion of the era, epitomized by the rise of the iconic <b>flapper</b> style. Women embraced shorter hemlines, bobbed hairstyles, and loose-fitting dresses that symbolized their liberation from traditional expectations.

                        <b>Technological advancements</b> also played a pivotal role in shaping 1920s fashion. Innovations like the invention of the zipper and the increasing use of synthetic fabrics such as rayon revolutionized clothing production.
