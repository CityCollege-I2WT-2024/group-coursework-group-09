            The <strong>grunge movement</strong>, heavily influenced by bands like Nirvana and Pearl Jam, brought about a rebellious, anti-fashion aesthetic. Key pieces included oversized flannel shirts, ripped jeans, combat boots, and graphic band tees. This style reflected a desire for comfort and individuality, breaking away from the polished looks of previous decades.  
        </p>
        <p>
            On the other hand, the rise of <strong>streetwear</strong> brought sporty and casual pieces to the forefront. Tracksuits, baggy jeans, sneakers, and branded items from companies like Adidas, Nike, and FUBU became essential for those looking to embrace the laid-back vibe of the era.  
        </p>
        <p>
            At the same time, <strong>minimalism</strong> gained popularity in high fashion, with simple silhouettes, neutral colors, and clean lines dominating runways. Designers like Calvin Klein and Donna Karan defined this trend, offering sleek slip dresses, tailored blazers, and monochromatic outfits that exuded effortless elegance.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Accessories like chokers, bucket hats, and tiny sunglasses also became iconic during this time, adding unique flair to everyday looks. The 1990s were a decade of blending subcultures, individuality, and practicality, making its fashion timeless and influential even today.

            Inspired by the <strong>grunge music scene</strong>, particularly bands like <strong>Nirvana</strong> and <strong>Pearl Jam</strong>, this trend rejected traditional fashion norms and embraced a rugged, undone look that symbolized rebellion and individuality. Grunge fashion became a defining feature of the 1990s, blending practicality with effortless cool. It was about authenticity, anti-establishment sentiment, and a laid-back attitude that resonated with youth culture.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Oversized flannel shirts</strong> and <strong>graphic band t-shirts</strong> formed the foundation of the look, often layered for a relaxed, nonchalant vibe. These pieces often had a worn-in feel, symbolizing the grunge movement’s resistance to polished, mainstream fashion.</li>
            <li><strong>Ripped or distressed jeans</strong>, frequently paired with tights or fishnet stockings underneath, added an edgy and worn-in aesthetic. The more torn and frayed, the better, as this signified the anti-fashion, rebellious spirit of the grunge scene.</li>
            <li><strong>Combat boots</strong>, particularly iconic brands like Doc Martens, became the go-to footwear, emphasizing durability and a tough attitude. The boots were often scuffed, signifying a look that was both practical and non-conformist.</li>
            <li><strong>Layered and casual pieces</strong>, often in dark, muted colors like black, gray, and earthy tones, created a style that was both functional and iconic. The grunge look rejected the bright, polished colors of the previous decade in favor of something more raw and real.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Grunge fashion wasn’t just a trend—it was a cultural statement, challenging the flashy consumerism of previous decades and embracing a more authentic, individualistic approach to style. The fashion of the grunge era spoke to those who wanted to stand out not by following trends but by rejecting them altogether. It was about personal expression and comfort over luxury, with an emphasis on self-identity rather than brand names. This cultural shift marked a turning point in how fashion was seen—no longer a vehicle for status, but a tool for self-representation.

Grunge fashion became a defining feature of the 1990s, blending practicality with effortless cool. The movement was a direct response to the excess and superficiality of the 1980s, offering a stark contrast through its raw and unpolished aesthetic. It was a subculture that sought to express frustration with societal pressures while celebrating authenticity and comfort.

            <li><strong>Oversized flannel shirts</strong> and <strong>graphic band t-shirts</strong> formed the foundation of the look, often layered for a relaxed, nonchalant vibe. These pieces, often thrifted or old, reflected the anti-consumerist attitude of grunge culture.</li>
            <li><strong>Ripped or distressed jeans</strong>, frequently paired with tights or fishnet stockings underneath, added an edgy and worn-in aesthetic. The frayed and torn look was symbolic of the movement’s rejection of mainstream beauty standards.</li>
            <li><strong>Combat boots</strong>, particularly iconic brands like Doc Martens, became the go-to footwear, emphasizing durability and a tough attitude.

            Comfort was key in the 90s, with an emphasis on sporty, casual wear that merged style and practicality.

The rise of branded sportswear helped to define a new, casual aesthetic that not only catered to comfort but also became a symbol of status and cultural identity.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Tracksuits</strong> from iconic brands like <strong>Adidas</strong> and <strong>Nike</strong> became popular for both sports and casual wear, offering comfort, a sleek look, and a sense of athleticism.
