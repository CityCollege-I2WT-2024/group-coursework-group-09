    <main>
     
        <p>Madonna, born Madonna Louise Ciccone on August 16, 1958, is one of the most iconic figures in pop music and fashion. Her career spans decades, and she has reinvented herself numerous times, influencing both the music and fashion industries in the process.</p>
        <p>Madonna was born in Bay City, Michigan, and raised in the Detroit suburb of Rochester Hills. She moved to New York City in the late 1970s to pursue a career in dance. Initially struggling to make ends meet, she worked as a waitress and took dance classes, all while exploring music and performing. Her first break came in the early 1980s when she signed with Sire Records and released her debut self-titled album in 1983. The album, featuring hits like “Holiday” and “Borderline,” quickly established her as a rising star.</p>

        <p>Madonna has been a fashion icon throughout her career, with her ever-changing style influencing global trends. Early on, in the 1980s, her look was characterized by bold accessories, lace tops, skirts over leggings, crucifixes, and a playful mix of masculinity and femininity. Her Like a Virgin era featured dramatic wedding dresses, while Material Girl became a fashion statement that invoked the glamour and excess of the 1980s.</p>
        <p>In the Vogue era (1990), Madonna helped popularize the concept of “high fashion” by embracing elements of couture, as well as the influence of old Hollywood glam. She continued to experiment with fashion in the Like a Prayer and Ray of Light eras, often incorporating spiritual and eclectic elements into her wardrobe. Her ability to collaborate with designers, such as Jean-Paul Gaultier for her Blonde Ambition tour in 1990, elevated her status as a style icon.</p>

        <p>Her career quickly skyrocketed, and Naomi Campbell became known for her fierce attitude and professionalism. She walked for nearly every top designer, including Jean-Paul Gaultier, Versace, Valentino, and Chanel, and appeared in countless high-profile advertising campaigns.</p>
