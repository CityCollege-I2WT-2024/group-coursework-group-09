            <h3>Kostandina Mara</h3>
            <p>Role: Developer</p>
            <p>Description: Hello everyone,
                I am Kostandina Mara, a 19-year-old student at City College, University of York in Thessaloniki. I chose to study Computer Science because I am passionate about technology and aspire to create innovative solutions to everyday problems. Additionally, this degree offers endless opportunities to develop my skills and build a strong career in the future.
                To share a bit more about myself, I would describe myself as an energetic, talkative person with a good sense of humor and plenty of patience. However, in some situations, I tend to speak without thinking. In my free time, I enjoy going for walks, shopping with friends, or reading books. My hobbies include boxing even though I’m a girl and playing volleyball, which I really enjoy. Lastly, I have a passion for creating TikTok videos!
                For this website project, I created the following pages: "Fashion Through the Decades" (covering the 1930s, 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s) and a page about "Fashion Icons." To build these pages, I used HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript. Working on this project was a highly creative experience, and the teamwork was excellent.I particularly enjoy working with CSS because it allows me to bring creative ideas to life and make websites visually appealing.
                If you’d like to contact me, feel free to email me at kmara@york.citycollege.eu.</p>
