            and a blending of past styles. It was a decade that celebrated individual expression and nostalgia,

                In the Americas, Australia and Japan, steampunk gained regional popularity among some young people aged 18-25. 
                From 2011 to 2015, members of this subculture often <strong>combined Neo-Victorian and Elegant Gothic aristocrat 
                clothing</strong> such as <u>top hats, pocket watches, or (for girls) corsets, velvet or brocade dresses, brooches, 
                and black, dark red or brown leather waistcoats, with bowties, hipster inspired beards and tweed clothing, 
                jewelry made from brass gears, dark skinny jeans, worker boots, and flying goggles.</u> American and Asian Steampunks 
                sometimes incorporate <u>pirate shirts or petticoats</u> borrowed from fantasy or Ren-Fair LARP, and <strong>elements of 
                Japanese street style</strong> such as Gothic Lolita inspired short skirts, traditional silk kimonos, or parasols.

                American Apparel made normcore a prominent aspect of hipster culture in the US from 2016 onwards. 
                The look is based on <u>modern business casual wear, everyday casual attire worn by older men, and the geek chic 
                clothing</u> worn by stereotypical nerds during the 1980s. Popular accessories include <u>horn rimmed glasses, 
                high waisted pants especially pleated khaki chinos, dad hats, zip up polar fleeces, white or blue button 
                down shirts, socks with sandals, turtlenecks, white tennis shoes, pocket protectors, leather shoes, 
                plain sweaters in muted colors, and, for women, "mom jeans".</u> <br> <br>
                The fanny pack accessory made a late comeback in 2018 with new packs introduced by <strong>fashion designers Gucci, 
                Prada, and Louis Vuitton</strong>. Reasons for the "belt bag" being in vogue was attributed to changing lifestyle needs 
                that made categories like luggage, backpacks and even fanny packs popular items on shopping and wish-lists during 
                the 2018 holiday season, along with a persisting taste for throwback fashion, particularly <strong>1980s nostalgia.</strong>
                <br> <br>
                By the early 2010s, British, American, and Filipino indie clothing had moved away from the bright colors 
                and overt 1960s styling of the mid-2000s in favor of a more <strong>"grown up" intellectual look,</strong> 
                with 1990s style earth-tones like <u>grey, burgundy, brown, teal, and beige.</u> <br>
                <u>Tweed jackets, skinny chino trousers, dress boots, layered shirts and tees, cardigan sweaters, 
                nerdy horn-rimmed glasses, sweaters, thick wool socks, worker boots, leggings, and beanies 
                replaced the winklepickers, velvet jackets, Aviator sunglasses, and skinny ties typically 
                worn by indie rock bands, although vintage Western shirts, leather jackets, military dress uniforms, 
                homemade jewelry, and thrift store chic plaid shirts remained popular in Europe</u>.<strong> Drop crotch pants </strong>
                became more and more popular in Europe amongst hipsters and hip hop fans, who <strong>replaced 
                their skinny jeans and carpenter jeans with "old school but modern" style.</strong>

                In the Americas, Britain, Australia, Ethiopia and the Philippines, many skaters wore <strong>designer streetwear</strong> 
                such as <u>joggers, hoodies, backwards baseball caps, and tracksuits in addition to the typical plaid shirts, 
                ripped jeans and trucker hats.</u> Common brands from 2012 to 2015 included <strong>Diamond Supply Co., Hollister, 
                The Hundreds, OBEY bar logo T-shirts and snapback hats, Vans, Converse All Stars, cannabis, camouflage or 
                foliage print shirts, Levi's jeans, Nike, LRG, DGK, Adidas Skateboarding and Originals apparel and shoes, 
                and T-shirts featuring the Santa Cruz Skateboards screaming hand, eyeball, "cartoon grotesque" faces,

                In the Americas, Malaysia, India, and China, an offshoot of the skater subculture, known as <strong>"sneakerheads",</strong> 
                dress similarly. Common mid-2010s sneakerhead apparel includes <u>Nike Air Jordans, Air Yeezys, Converse Moderns, 
                Nike SBs, DC Spartans, Supra Sky-Tops, Vans, designer sportswear, True Religion slim fit jeans, backwards 
                baseball caps, red high-tops with fluorescent or reflective white stars, Skullcandy headphones, leggings, 
                slouched crew socks, and Keds (for girls), Aviator sunglasses, waffle plaid shirts, throwback basketball singlets, 
                tracksuits, Nike Elite socks, cosmic print T-shirts, hoodies, and Nixon watches.</u> As of 2016, <strong>the most desirable 
                colors for sneakers and apparel were black, red and white</strong> due to their longstanding association with late 1980s 
                new wave music, the Michael Jordan era of basketball, and old school hip-hop.

                During the early 2010s, American preppy guys moved away from the hip-hop influenced fashions of the 2000s

                tapered chinos became popular for guys. <br> <br> 
    
                Throughout the 2010s, Preppy girls wore flip flops, ballet flats, boat shoes, white casual Sperry sneakers, 
                flat ankle boots with tights or crew or knee socks slouched down over tights, leggings, jeggings or skinny jeans,

                Europe, Australasia, parts of Asia, and South America, especially in the Brazilian city of Fortaleza.</u> 
                The style was influenced by <strong>hip-hop, emo, Japanese street style, and indie pop fashion,</strong> especially 
                skinny jeans, trucker hats, Nike shoes, mismatched neon green, fluorescent yellow, bright blue or hot pink socks worn
