                Popular Materials: Silk: A luxurious choice for evening gowns and blouses. Satin, charmeuse, and crepe de chine were common silk weaves. Rayon: Known as artificial silk, it was an affordable alternative used for dresses, lingerie, and blouses. Wool: Favored for suits, coats, and winter dresses, especially in heavier weaves like tweed or gabardine. Cotton: Used for casual daywear and house dresses, often with colorful patterns. Velvet: A popular choice for eveningwear, adding richness and texture. Chiffon: Lightweight and sheer, chiffon was often layered for soft, flowing gowns. Linen: Ideal for warm-weather clothing, especially suits and casual dresses. Textile Innovations: The bias-cut, pioneered by Madeleine Vionnet, became a hallmark of the decade, allowing fabrics to drape beautifully over the body. Fabrics were thinner and softer than in previous decades, emphasizing movement and flow. Patterns and Prints: Floral prints were popular for both daywear and eveningwear. Stripes, polka dots, and geometric patterns added visual interest to garments. Art Deco-inspired designs occasionally appeared in accessories and eveningwear.
