            "To this day, Italy’s name is synonymous with trends in high fashion, which was true for the country since the <strong>
            Renaissance.</strong> Italy’s reputation in fashion was first set by the monarchy. Everyone wanted to dress like the nobility, 
            and they dressed lavishly. The 15th century was a time of <u>artistic flourishing and vibrant colors.</u> Women in Italy wore 
            <u>elaborate clothing, jewelry, makeup, and other accessories</u> while men wore <u>pigmented colors and intricate embroideries </u>
            on their tunics, both to signal their position and authority. You can often see this in Leonardo da Vinci’s portraits of the 
            Florentine elite. <br> <br>
            During this time, cities such as <u>Florence, Venice, Milan, Naples, and Rome</u> produced their own textiles and fabrics like 
            <u>wool, silk, and velvet.</u> The legacy of this industry lasted through the mid-20th century when the fashion market started 
            to become increasingly <strong>competitive.</strong> That’s when Milan began to make a real name for itself. <br> <br>
            Big names in fashion like <strong>Giovanni Battista Giorgini, Emilio Pucci, and the Fontana sisters</strong> used celebrities and the
            influence of the growing popularity of the film industry to put on fashion shows in <u>Rome, Venice, and Florence.</u> 
            Italy was fast becoming the destination for clothing trends around the world, and Milan emerged <strong>victorious</strong> 
            as the city known for fashion. <br> <br>
            By the later half of the 20th century, Milan was a prominent industrial city with good manufacturing connections. 
            Designers turned to this Italian fashion mecca for its <strong>trend-setting status</strong>, especially after 1961 when it was the headquarters 
            of Vogue Italia. Milan-based pioneers in fashion, <strong>Giorgio Armani and Gianni Versace,</strong> also had a huge hand in solidifying the 
            city’s name even further after their designs became very popular. <br> <br>
            Milan’s Fashion Week finalized the city’s reputation for <strong>cutting-edge fashion.</strong> Versace’s 1991 show, 
            featuring supermodels like <u>Cindy Crawford, Naomi Campbell, and more,</u> embodied the popularity and buzz around this 
            lavish week. Adorned in the <u>beautiful patterns, cuts, and colors</u> of the iconic designers, these opulent shows have 
            attracted the likes of other fashion names like Gucci. Suddenly, Milan was part of the global big four in fashion."
